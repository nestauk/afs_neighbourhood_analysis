# Clustering results

In this section we present the results of our clustering analysis:

- What C/UAs are assigned to what clusters, where are they, how do we interpret the clusters? (@subsec:output}
- What are the differences between clusters in early year outcomes in the latest update of the data (2019) and historically?
- Who are the outperforming and underperforming C/UAs inside each cluster in the latest version of the data and historically? Are these differences linked to structural and contextual differences between C/UAs _inside_ clusters?

## Clustering outputs {#subsec:output}

### Cluster assignment results

The cluster assignment procedure with the parameters that maximise variation in early year outcomes between clusters yields six clusters. [@tab:assignments] shows the top ten C/UAs per cluster by population.[^1]

[^1]: We use mid-2020 all-ages population estimates obtained from ONS [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland)
