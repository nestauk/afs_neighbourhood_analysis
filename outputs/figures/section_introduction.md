# Introduction

There are many factors which contribute towards a child's development. From the nurture of their parents and the home learning environment to the area in which they grow up. Each Local Authority in England has different funding, different services and a different environment. It is hard to disentangle which factors that influence a child's life have the most effect on their development. There have been many studies that try to determine what exactly makes a child "school-ready", defined here as reaching a Good Level of Development (GLD) in the [Early Years Foundation Stage Profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-handbook) (EYFSP). We know that their Free School Meals (FSM) status, the physical and mental health of their parents, their parents' income and smoking in pregnancy all affect whether they are school ready ([Isaacs, J., 2012](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0319_school_disadvantage_isaacs.pdf); [Peterson, J. et al., 2018](https://www.publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-split/142/5/e20181126/38543/The-Intersection-of-Health-and-Education-to?autologincheck=redirected); [Brophy, S. et al., 2021](https://www.adruk.org/fileadmin/uploads/adruk/Documents/Data_Insight_Risk_factors_for_not_being_ready_to_start_school__February_2021_.pdf); [Cooper, K., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0038038520939397)).

However, we know that there are different levels of the percentage of children reaching a Good Level of Development (GLD) in each Local Authority (LA). Figure \ref{gld_grouped} contains a number of plots which shows how gender can have an effect on the percentage reaching a GLD as well as the IMD decile. The gender gap is slowing closing over time, and the percentage of children reaching a GLD has been increasing since 2012, but this is now slowing. We have picked out the London boroughs in pink, as areas such as Hackney, Lewisham and Barking and Dagenham, have a noticeably higher GLD percentage than other LAs in England of the same IMD decile.

(Bottom middle) The mean percentage point change in GLD for each year, separated by gender. \label{gld_grouped}](png/gld_descriptive_stats_grouped_plot.png){#fig:gld_grouped}

We can see this more clearly in the choropleths and bar charts in Figures \ref{choro_all} and \ref{choro_fsm}. Figure \ref{choro_all} shows the trends in GLD for all children, whilst Figure \ref{choro_fsm} shows it for only those on Free School Meals (FSM). For all children, there is a north/south divide with many of the top 20 LAs with the lowest percentage of children reaching a GLD situated in the north of England, and vice versa for the highest percentage. On the choropleth map, we can clearly see a cluster of LAs in the north west of England around Lancashire, Manchester and Liverpool who have a much lower percentage. However, when we look at the percentage of children on FSMs reaching a GLD, the patterns change (Figure \ref{choro_fsm}). Some of the more deprived London boroughs have the highest percentage of children on FSMs reaching GLDs, and although there are still areas in the north such as Cumbria, Liverpool and Leeds with low percentages of children on FSM reaching a GLD, wealthier LAs in the south have now appeared. Areas such as Wiltshire, Bedfordshire and West Sussex which have quite high percentages of children reaching a GLD overall, are not bringing the FSM children up to the same level.

There is a lot more to consider here than the school readiness factors highlighted above. Why are certain LAs "outperforming" similar LAs which, at first glance, appear to have similar demographics and levels of deprivation.

To investigate this, we have used clustering to group LAs together. Instead of clustering them on known factors of school readiness (as we already know this has an effect on outcomes), we have used 300+ indicators from the [Fingertips Public Health England](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) dataset. These vary from information about the local area in terms of diversity, socio-economic status to the percentage of the population that is obese or the percentage of adults that feel lonely. By using such a wide variety of features, we can group LAs on a more diverse range of factors. From here, we can then look at the percentage of children in each LA which reach a GLD. This will then enable us to find LAs which have greater numbers of chilren reaching a GLD relative to other LAs in their cluster, and vice versa. We can look at inter and intra cluster characteristics, to determine what may be affecting school readiness. However, we will not be able to draw any causal conclusions from this. To supplement the data analysis, an ambitious qualitative survey of the LAs in England will be conducted to map their policy and practice around Early Years. We can use the clusters to find the LAs to pilot the survey on, taking a range of LAs from those which are outperforming relative to their clusters to those which we notice have specific factors which could be influencing the school readiness. Provided the pilot is a success, the ambition is to scale this up to survey all 151 LAs in England, providing one of the most thorough mappings of Early Years practice ever conducted.

This approach we are taking is different to previous analyses of school readiness factors. Typically Randomised Control Trials or OLS Regressions are conducted in an attempt to find the causal link. We are not using either of these techniques, predominately as we are not aiming to build a causal model. The Fingertips dataset is a large dataset where there will be many confounders. We are not trying to minimise the effects of confounders, rather we are trying to link LAs together which have similar characteristics. The presence of the survey after the data analysis means we are not restrained in trying to restrict this to causal factors. Furthermore, we have used a clustering pipeline - running several different clustering models with different hyperparameters to link LAs together. The more times an LA is linked to another, the more likely they are to be in the same cluster, thus adding a robustness to this methodology.

In the remainder of this paper we firstly discuss the methodology and the datasets in more detail, followed by the results of clustering analysis. Here we look in more detail at the clusters, and the factors they have been grouped on. We investigate the diversity of them, and the trends in the EYFSP for each cluster. Finally, we look at inter- and intra-cluster characterisitics in known causal drivers of Early Years performance and any systematic differences between them.

### NOTE: Need to add some conclusions.
