# Conclusions

Our analysis has revealed a number of insights about the situation and evolution of early year performance in different parts of England. 

Our clusters reflect in part geography, with clusters 1 and 3 mostly in the North, cluster 5 in London and cluster 4 in the South, and in part demography, with cluster 4 comprising C/UAs with older populations and clusters 2 and 5 more ethnically diverse populations.  

When we compare clusters in their early year performance we detect important differences between a cluster of affluent C/UAs in the Greater South East (cluster 0) and other parts in the country, notably a cluster comprising cities in the Midlands, North West and Yorkshire (cluster 2). Clusters 6 and 7, with older populations and lower levels of deprivation, also perform better than clusters in the North. These results are consistent with the idea that the localised (economic and social) challenges faced in different parts of the country shape their early years outcomes and the policies that need to be put in place to improve these outcomes. 

Having said this, we also find some early year challenges in wealthier parts of the country, such as cluster 4, which includes cities in the South such as Bristol, Reading and Southampton, which has experienced a decline in its EFSYP average point score between 2013 and 2019 and stagnated in its ability to equalise early year outcomes between boys and girls.

It is very important to highlight what our analysis _has not done_, which is to explain the reason for differences in performance between clusters as well as between outperforming and underperforming C/UAs inside clusters. We will consider some of these questions in follow-on research, with a particular focus on potential differences in policy between C/UAs that might explain differences in outcomes despite similarities in context.
